## Introduction

Seapath performance tool focuses on assessing the efficiency and reliability of a
Seapath architecture by performing network latency tests. Using
IEC61850 protocol, Samples Value are emitted from a publisher machine
in destination of a subscriber machine, which will receive, parse, and
decode them. The subscriber machine can be a physical machine or a
virtual machine hosted on an hypervisor.

NOTE: Each of the machine used are running a Seapath standalone
distribution. There is currently no support for a Seapath cluster
configuration.

Various latency metrics are computed at various stage of the transit of the Samples
Value between each machine, and inside them:

- Network latency: Time elapsed between the emission of an SV (T0) from the
  publisher machine to the NIC of the subscriber (T3) or of the
  hypervisor machine (T1).
- Hypervisor latency: Time elapsed between the reception of an SV on
  the NIC of the hypervisor machine (T1) to the end of the proceed of
  it (T2). This latency is computed only in the
  context of a virtualized subscriber.
- Transit latency: Time elapsed between the end of the proceed of an SV on
  the on the hypervisor machine (T2) to the reception of the SV on the NIC
  of the subscriber machine (T3). This latency is computed only in the
  context of a virtualized subscriber.
- subscriber latency: Time elapsed between the reception of an SV on
  the NIC of the subscriber (T3) machine to the end of the proceed of
  it (T4).

At the end of each test, are generated various graph and a test report
in `tests_results` directory.

This project is essential for ensuring that the Seapath platform meets
the stringent requirements of real-time applications, particularly in
the power grid industry.

## Features

- High precision and reliable latency test (+/- 10Âµs)
- Identify bottleneck in a Seapath architecture (hypervisor, subscriber)
- Identify bottleneck inside a Seapath machine

## Installation
### Requirements
#### System packages

Make sure your localhost system comply with the following dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt install \
docker
```

Install `cqfd`:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/cqfd.git
cd cqfd
sudo make install
```

#### Seapath machine

A valid IEC61850 PCAP file is needed on the publisher machine. The
selection of this file can be achieved using `pcap_file` inventory
variable.

## Configuration
###  Time synchronization

For achieving high accuracy latency measure each machine must be
synchronized using the PTP protocol.
To implement PTP on Seapath you can follow the detailed procedure in
the Seapath Wiki, section "Time synchronization":
https://wiki.lfenergy.org/display/SEAP/Time+synchronization

For better PTP performance, we recommend:
- The isolation, if possible of `ptp4l` and `phc2sys` process
- To use an hardware PTP source
- To use PTP L2 network transport and P2P delay mechanism
- To use linreg clock servo for `ptp4l` and `phc2sys` configuration
- In the case of a virtual machine as a subscriber, using `kvm_ptp`
module is highly recommended.

For the Seapath performance tool project, PTP can be configured on Seapath machine
without `timemaster` package. To do so:

1. Make sure `ptp4l` and `phc2sys` utilities are installed on each
Seapath machine
2. `timemaster.service` is disabled on each Seapath machine:
```bash
systemctl disable timemaster.service
```

3. PTP variables are correctly configured in your Seapath performance tool inventories
files; See README file in `inventories/` directory. In particular, make
sure `ptp_manual_configuration` is defined.
4. Finally, you can run the playbook `configure_latency_tests.yaml` using:
```bash
cqfd -b configure_tests
```

### General configuration

Seapath machines configuration for the Seapath performance tool project can be set in
the dedicated inventories files. See `inventories/README` for more
information.

The configuration can be applied with the `configure_latency_tests.yaml` playbook:

```bash
cqfd -b configure_tests
```

NOTE: this playbook must be run again each time a variable is modified in a
Seapath performance tool inventory.

## Usage

After configuration, the tests can be launched with the playbook
`run_latency_tests.yaml`:
```bash
cqfd -b run_tests
```

Test duration can be set achieved using `pcap_cycles` inventory
variable.

For CI purpose, you can also use the `launch_tests.sh` script.
